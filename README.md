# Lottery-Number-Supplier-Wordpress
Overview: This is a wordpress plugin that enables one to get 'Quick Pick' numbers for playing in selected lotteries. 

Introduction: The approval this past August 1st by WP for addition to their directory at WordPress.org of my new plugin ‘Lottery Number Supplier ‘ enables me to announce its availability for general use.

Summary:  This free plugin enables the subscribers of a WordPress blog or site to get 'Quick Pick' numbers that are suitable for playing in a selection of some ten of the biggest and most popular multi-state lotteries.

Plugin Name: Lottery Number Supplier

Plugin URL: https://wordpress.org/plugins/lottery-number-supplier/

Description:  

The plugin gives a WP site's logged-in visitors the ability to pick lottery numbers from the convenience of their own tablet or home computer, without them needing to rely on a terminal operator at the store for obtaining random numbers to play.

It can rapidly provide as many lines of quick picks as your visitors request within reasonable limits, while at the same time taking up a bare minimum of your page's real estate with an attractive, compact box that is at most only four rows deep and narrower than 300 pixels.

Liven up your WP site with this fun and easy-to-use feature that will help increase user engagement and attract more repeat visits.

You can implement the plugin by simply inserting where you want the "Quick Picker" to appear in your WordPress blog's the following shortcode:

 [lotsup]  

This will result in the appearance of a mini-box that displays within it a drop-down list of lotteries with alongside it a “Pick” button and a next row containing a text-area that serves as a response line.

When your page’s logged-in visitor clicks the “Pick” button after having selected a lottery, a row of 'quick pick' numbers that meet the requirements of their chosen lottery will be supplied in the response line. Such a user will then be able to repeat this to get more rows of numbers for the same lottery selection or for any other one chosen in place of the prior selection. 

This plugin is a fast implementation of PHP that leaves a small footprint and one that was built in part with AJAX technology to enhance its dynamic operation; it integrates well with the rest of WordPress. 

(This is not an application that will also enter the numbers it supplies into any lottery, as its functions do not extend to enabling your readers to actually play a lottery.)

Please feel free to try out this plugin by taking it for a drive around the block, so to speak.  J
